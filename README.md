# RobinLite: A Simple Stock Dashboard

# Inspiration
I built this project because I’m fascinated by how technology can make finance more accessible. Robinhood’s design philosophy—simple, fast, and empowering—inspired me to create a dashboard that captures that same spirit.  
This project helped me deepen my understanding of React components, API integration, and data visualization.
